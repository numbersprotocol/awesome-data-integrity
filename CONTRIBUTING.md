# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

## 1. Before submitting

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one to ensure no duplicates
* If you just created something, wait a few weeks before submitting.
* Revew the content policy to ensure your submission meets the requirements.

## 2. Creating a submission

Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.

Make sure to create a **new feature branch** before editing README.

## 3. Submitting through PR

* The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the content and why it should be included.
* Submit products that are useable, or at a state which has something to show which is awesome. This rule is in place to cut down half finished implementations.

**Thanks for your suggestions!**
